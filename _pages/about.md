I am an Applied Deep Learning engineer specializing in Computer Vision for medical imaging, designing AI systems that drive clinical efficiency, reduce operational friction, and support data-driven decision-making for healthcare providers and industry stakeholders.

At [Pearl AI](https://www.hellopearl.com/), I contribute to the development and scaling of production-grade diagnostic models and inference platforms deployed across real-world dental practices. My work focuses on improving model reliability, streamlining integration, and supporting the delivery of AI solutions that generate measurable clinical and operational value at scale.

I operate at the intersection of engineering, product, and applied research, translating state-of-the-art computer vision into commercial solutions aligned with regulatory, performance, and go-to-market constraints.

In parallel, I teach Deep Learning and Computer Vision, with a strong emphasis on applied methodologies, real-world deployment constraints, and the translation of research outcomes into production-ready solutions.
